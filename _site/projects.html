											The Startup Story is an independent blog and website designed to act as a useful repository of all things
											relating to entrepreneurship and the startup scene in the UK. <br /><br />
											The original blog was a record of my first year in London, having moved down to follow a
											12-month course in business and entrepreneurship through the <a href="http://newentrepreneursfoundation.com/" target="_blank">New Entrepreneurs Foundation</a><br /><br />
											Since then I’ve grown my network, my knowledge of the UK startup scene,
											and amassed a wealth of knowledge and resources to help founding teams build
											and grow their startups. The Startup Story blog is a collection of all this information
											and more, all in one (hopefully!) easy to navigate and digest resource. <br /><br />
											Hope you find something of value and great use to you on your own journey!

											<strong>Their blurb:</strong><br /><br />
											The New Entrepreneurs Foundation (NEF) aims to provide the UK’s leading entrepreneurial
											training programme to fast-track young, talented, aspiring entrepreneurs to start their
											own businesses.  We do this by selecting the UK’s brightest and most entrepreneurial young
											people and by providing them with a unique, 12-month programme which consists of five main
											components: a paid work placement in an entrepreneurial company; an intensive fast-track
											learning programme; monthly speaker & networking events; an executive coach and a business
											mentor. Through this programme, our New Entrepreneurs are equipped with the hands-on experience,
											skills and networks to build scalable businesses. <br /><br />
											<strong>Some more info:</strong><br /><br />
											So the NEF is a London based charity with a mission to nurture and promote
											entrepreneurship and start up businesses in the UK. Each year the NEF takes
											on a class or ‘cohort’ of around 30-40 young aspiring entrepreneurs and business
											minds, with the aim of providing them the best programme of learning, hands-on
											work experience, and networking events etc. to equip them with the tools to successfully
											launch or grow their own business ventures now and in the future. <br /><br />
											I was a member of the class of 2014 and can’t recommend the 1-year course highly
											enough! More information on the NEF can be found <a href="http://www.newentrepreneursfoundation.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>.

											<strong>Status:</strong> exited business. <strong>Technologies:</strong> built and hosted using the Squarespace CMS. <br /><br />
											Multisite Masters is a new Podcast audiobook focusing on how to better manage and grow
											multi-site businesses. <br /><br />
											I founded and started work on Multisite Masters whilst at Yapster. It was originally
											conceived as a sales lead-generation mechanism for the Yapster product. I then spun
											this out of Yapster in the New Year to be a separate entity and have been running and
											growing this small business on my own since. <br /><br />
											In July 2017 I sold the assets of Mutisite Masters to the business management and
											training consultancy Mastering Multi-Units (MMU). MMU have a fantastic team and well-focused
											mission to help retail and hospitality businesses thrive through better multi-site management
											and training. Their work aligns very well with Multisite Masters so it was a great fit and easy
											decision to handover the MSM Podcast into their very capable hands.

											<strong>Status:</strong> ongoing involvement. <strong>Technologies:</strong> physical consumer product, laser-etching, micro-prisms, LED technologies. <br /><br />
											Through the last 6-9mths I have been supporting a small Startup team based in Yorkshire,
											in their efforts to bring to market a novel new car alarm system. I was brought in to analyse
											and improve their existing business plan, then seek out and pitch for private equity investment
											to fund the next stage of the venture. <br /><br />
											The Luminescent Car Alarm is a revolutionary new car alarm system, which conceals a hidden
											‘stolen’ message within a modified vehicle number plate. Once triggered, it alerts the vehicle
											owner, and then also passers-by and the Police to a theft - by activating the highly visual
											display alert.
